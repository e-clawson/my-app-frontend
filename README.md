# Double Bass Database 

Double Bass Database is a resource for bassists to explore bass music avaiable to perform. Double bass music is a niche area of music publication, and as a result, it can be difficult to find music to perform. Double Bass Database seeks to solve this issue by providing bassists with an open-source list of bass music to browse. Users can login, see the complete list, and favorite pieces that are then populated into their individual user favorites list on their user page. 

This project was designed to fufill the requirements of Flatiron School's part-time software engineering course phase 3 project, and is still in development.
